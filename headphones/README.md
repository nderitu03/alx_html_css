# Headphones – Implement a design from scratch

![Headphones preview](https://i.imgur.com/...) <!-- Optional: add screenshot later -->

This project consists of implementing a **responsive landing page from scratch** using only **HTML** and **CSS**, without any external framework (no Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.) and **without JavaScript**.

The design was created by **Nicolas Philippot** (UI/UX designer).

**Objective**: Reproduce the Figma design as faithfully as possible, paying attention to layout, typography, colors, spacing, hover/active states, and mobile responsiveness (switch to mobile layout ≤ 480px).

## Project requirements

- No external CSS framework allowed
- No JavaScript allowed
- Use semantic HTML5 elements whenever possible
- Ensure accessibility basics (good contrast, alt texts, proper heading hierarchy)
- Responsive design: page must adapt correctly on screens ≤ 480px
- Max content width: **1000px**, centered
- Hover / active states:
  - Links: color `#FF6565`
  - Buttons: `opacity: 0.9`
- Fonts: **Source Sans Pro** (main text) + **Spin Cycle OT** (if used in logo / headings)

## Figma – How to access the design

1. Create a free account on [Figma](https://www.figma.com) if you don't have one.
2. Open the project:  
   [Figma design link](https://www.figma.com/... ) <!-- paste the real link from your ALX task -->
3. Click **Duplicate to your Drafts** (top right corner) to get your own editable copy.
4. If you can't access it, use the backup file provided in the task.

**Important Figma notes**:
- Fonts used: **Source Sans Pro** (Google Fonts) and **Spin Cycle OT** (download if missing)
- Some values (paddings, margins) are in decimals → round them reasonably
- Inspect elements in Figma to get exact colors, sizes, spacings

**Fonts download** (if needed):
- [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
- [Spin Cycle OT](https://... ) <!-- search for it or use the link from ALX -->
